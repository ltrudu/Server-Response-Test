## 📱 Battery Optimization

### Battery Usage Patterns

#### High Battery Usage Scenarios
```
Configuration:
├── Time Between Sessions: 1000ms (1 second)
├── Server Count: 10+ servers
├── Request Type: HTTPS (multiple)
├── Duration: Infinite requests
└── Battery Impact: Very High (2-4 hours)

Usage Pattern: Real-time monitoring, development testing
```

#### Moderate Battery Usage
```
Configuration:
├── Time Between Sessions: 5000ms (5 seconds)
├── Server Count: 5-8 servers
├── Request Type: Mixed HTTPS/Ping
├── Duration: Infinite requests
└── Battery Impact: Moderate (6-8 hours)

Usage Pattern: Regular monitoring, production checks
```

#### Low Battery Usage (Recommended)
```
Configuration:
├── Time Between Sessions: 30000ms (30 seconds)
├── Server Count: 3-5 servers
├── Request Type: Prefer Ping
├── Duration: Finite requests (100-200)
└── Battery Impact: Low (12+ hours)

Usage Pattern: Background monitoring, scheduled checks
```

### Battery Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Optimize Test Intervals
```
// Poor battery performance
Time Between Sessions: 1000ms
Estimated battery life: 2-3 hours

// Good battery performance  
Time Between Sessions: 30000ms
Estimated battery life: 12+ hours

// Calculation formula:
Battery life ≈ Base capacity / (Test frequency × Server count × Request overhead)
```

#### 2. Server Count Management
```
Servers vs Battery Impact:
├── 1-3 servers: Minimal impact
├── 4-6 servers: Low impact
├── 7-10 servers: Moderate impact
└── 10+ servers: High impact

Recommended limits:
├── Background monitoring: 3-5 servers
├── Active monitoring: 5-8 servers
└── Development testing: 8-10 servers
```

#### 3. Request Type Selection
```
Battery efficiency ranking (best to worst):
1. Ping (ICMP): Lowest overhead
2. HTTPS (simple): Moderate overhead
3. HTTPS (complex): Higher overhead

Power consumption comparison:
├── Ping: ~1 unit per request
├── HTTPS (200ms): ~3 units per request
└── HTTPS (500ms+): ~5+ units per request
```

### Device-Specific Battery Settings

#### Android Battery Optimization
```

```

## 🌐 Network Performance

### Network Efficiency Patterns

#### Request Type Comparison
```
HTTPS Requests:
├── Data usage: 1-5 KB per request
├── CPU usage: Moderate (SSL processing)
├── Network overhead: Higher
├── Accuracy: HTTP status + timing
└── Best for: Web services, APIs

Ping Requests:
├── Data usage: <100 bytes per request
├── CPU usage: Low
├── Network overhead: Minimal
├── Accuracy: Reachability + timing
└── Best for: Infrastructure, databases
```

#### Network Optimization Strategies

1. **Prefer Ping for Infrastructure**
```
Good configuration:
├── Web servers: HTTPS
├── API endpoints: HTTPS
├── Database servers: Ping
├── Routers/switches: Ping
└── Internal services: Ping

Result: 60-70% reduction in data usage
```

2. **Optimize Test Timing**
```
Peak hours (high latency):
├── Increase intervals: 10000ms+
├── Reduce server count
├── Use ping for basic connectivity

Off-peak hours (low latency):
├── Normal intervals: 5000ms
├── Full server testing
├── Mixed HTTPS/Ping
```

3. **Connection Management**
```
App network behavior:
├── Connection pooling: Not implemented
├── Keep-alive: Standard HTTP behavior
├── Timeout settings: 5 seconds
├── Retry logic: None (single attempt)
└── Concurrent requests: All servers tested simultaneously
```

### Mobile Data Considerations

#### Data Usage Estimates
```
Per test cycle data usage:
├── 1 HTTPS server: ~2 KB
├── 1 Ping server: ~0.1 KB
├── 5 mixed servers: ~6 KB

Daily usage (30s intervals):
├── 5 servers: ~17 MB/day
├── 10 servers: ~35 MB/day
├── 20 servers: ~70 MB/day

Monthly estimates:
├── Light usage (5 servers): ~500 MB/month
├── Normal usage (10 servers): ~1 GB/month
├── Heavy usage (20 servers): ~2 GB/month
```

#### Mobile Data Optimization
```
Recommended mobile settings:
├── Time Between Sessions: 60000ms (1 minute)
├── Server Count: 3-5 essential servers
├── Request Type: Prefer Ping
├── Duration: Finite requests (50-100)
└── Schedule: Specific time windows only
